## Rust Functions for Unity
### Tower Lord

I made this repo because I wanted to learn Rust and see if I could squeeze more performance out of Unity.

Naturally, that meant writing unsafe code, exporting C functions, and pretending C# and Rust are best friends.

There’s some hashing, grid logic, binary searches — all the stuff you write when you’re procrastinating real game features.

It works, it’s fast, and it might explode your editor if you’re not careful. Skål.
